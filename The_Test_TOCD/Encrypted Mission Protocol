# Encrypted Practices – TOCD

This directory is part of the **Try Of Check Dogs (TOCD)** plan and contains all **encrypted practices** developed under the **Encrypted Mission Protocol**.

Each file in this directory is a realistic simulation of receiving sensitive intelligence, in which you must **decrypt and execute the mission** following the specified procedure.

> **Note:** The content is not visible in plain text. You must follow the decryption steps using `gpg` to access the instructions.

# Encrypted Mission Protocol

**Light Practice Format – Sensitive Intelligence Simulation**

This protocol replaces the traditional delivery of practice instructions in plain text for **PBR** (Proof-of-Bounty-Readiness) and **PAD** (Attack and Defense Practices).  
Instead, all instructions are delivered in **encrypted format** and can only be read if the proper steps are followed.

---

## Objective

Recreate the workflow of a real offensive cybersecurity environment, where orders and critical information **are never exposed directly**.  
This protocol strengthens skills in:

- Secure handling of sensitive data.
- Using **GnuPG** (`gpg`) for encryption and decryption.
- Maintaining a secure workflow in a hacking lab environment.

---

## Operational Procedure

### 1. Receiving the mission
- You will be provided with an encrypted data block in GPG (ASCII-armored) format.
- Example block:
    ```
    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
    
    hQGMA2kQkYX3h13wAQv+NgkzRvP6o1X8Mox+L6FZxkG41jk4zPUyDl7ff1uZ3TrB
    ...
    =0a1B
    -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
    ```

### 2. Creating the file in the VM
- Save the message in a file inside your Kali virtual machine:
    ```bash
    nano mission.gpg
    ```
- Paste the encrypted block into the file and save.

### 3. Decrypting the mission
- Run:
    ```bash
    gpg --decrypt mission.gpg
    ```
- If prompted, enter the password provided with the encrypted block.

### 4. Reading and executing
- Once decrypted, you will receive the complete practice instructions.
- Execute the mission following the steps and document the results.

---

## Example Usage

```bash
# Save the mission
nano mission.gpg

# Decrypt
gpg --decrypt mission.gpg

Expected output:

Mission: Scan the internal network and document active hosts.
Tools: nmap, netdiscover.
Objective: Identify possible attack vectors.

Protocol Benefits

    Security: Prevents accidental exposure of instructions in insecure channels.

    Realism: Simulates how sensitive data is handled in real-world cybersecurity operations.

    Operational discipline: Promotes safe and traceable handling of confidential information.
