Try Of Check Dogs (TOCD) – My Learning Path

Objective: To become a Reverse Engineer and Malware Developer specialized in defense evasion, with the ability to build, modify, hide, and bypass mechanisms such as firewalls, EDRs, and other security solutions on both Microsoft and Linux environments.

What is TOCD: Try Of Check Dogs is my self-directed learning path, designed to be carried out before, during, and after my university studies at Tep PCMM – PUCMM and with the goal of entering the Johns Hopkins University Master’s in Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Analysis.

The purpose of this path:

    Build a solid technical profile that will allow me to stand out in the job market and in offensive cybersecurity.

    Obtain key certifications that validate my skills and increase my visibility in the professional field, with the aim of funding my advanced studies at JHU.

    Practice and earn rewards in the Bug Bounty world.

My Methodology: Deep-Dive & Layered

In a field as broad and complex as cybersecurity — especially in reverse engineering — simply gathering information is not enough. It must be assimilated deeply, logically, and progressively.
That’s why I created the Deep-Dive & Layered philosophy, a methodology designed so that each piece of knowledge builds firmly upon the previous one.
TOCD Structure

Phase → Block → Stack → Mastery Evaluation

    Phase: The highest level, representing a macro objective and a leap in competence.
    Example:

        Phase 1: Solid fundamentals (hardware, OS, low-level programming).

        Phase 2: Initial practical application (basic malware analysis, reversing).

        Phase 3: Advanced mastery (complex malware, exploit development, high-level evasion).

    Block: A specific thematic grouping within a Phase, such as “Computer Architecture & Assembly Language” or “Operating System Internals.”

    Stack: The smallest unit of study, made up of topics or tools learned sequentially to complete a Block.

    Mastery Evaluation: A practical test to ensure skills can be applied in real scenarios. May include:

        Solving CrackMes.

        Development or scripting projects.

        Reversing and evasion exercises.

Practice Types in TOCD

    CTF (Capture The Flag): Guided exercises to build theoretical and practical foundations.

    PBR (Proof-of-Bounty-Readiness): Real-world challenge-based projects oriented toward Bug Bounty, with preparation and documented execution.

    PAD (Aptitude Test): Intensive practice days to deepen skills in critical areas such as systems programming, reverse engineering, or exploit development.

This is not a standard course. It is a comprehensive development plan combining theory, practice, simulations, and real-world challenges, designed to produce tangible results: solid skills, a demonstrable public portfolio, and the capability to operate effectively in real offensive cybersecurity environments.
