# Try Of Check Dogs (TOCD) — Learning Path 

**Objective.** Develop professional competence in **Reverse Engineering** and **Malware Development** with an emphasis on **defense-evasion R\&D**—i.e., understanding how controls work and how to measure/improve them—across Microsoft and Linux environments. All work is performed **in isolated lab VMs** under explicit **OPSEC/Legal** constraints.

## What is TOCD?

**TOCD (Try Of Check Dogs)** is my self-directed curriculum. It runs **before, during, and after** my studies at **TEP PUCMM**, and is designed to position me for a future master’s program at **Johns Hopkins University (JHU)** focused on reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis.

**Why this path:**

* Build a deep, verifiable technical profile for offensive security roles.
* Earn targeted certifications that validate skills and improve employability (and help fund advanced studies).
* Practice responsibly in **bug bounty** programs and build a public portfolio of results.

## Methodology: Deep-Dive & Layered

Cybersecurity—especially reversing—requires more than collecting notes. TOCD follows a **Deep-Dive & Layered** approach where each layer of knowledge is **assimilated, practiced, documented, and validated** before moving on.

* **Hands-on first:** every block includes a **PBR** (reproducible lab).
* **Documentation discipline:** every PBR is paired with a **PAD** (analysis & documentation).
* **Evidence-driven:** progress is measured against a **defensive baseline** (Sysmon/ETW, YARA/Sigma, KQL) to quantify signal vs noise.

> **Terminology (consistent across the repo)**
>
> * **PBR** = *Reproducible Lab* (aka “Proof-of-Bounty-Readiness”): challenge-based, step-by-step, versioned evidence.
> * **PAD** = *Practice, Analysis & Documentation*: methods, diagrams, findings, and reproducibility notes.

## Structure: Phase → Block → Stack → Mastery Check

* **Phase** — Macro objective and competence jump.

  * *Examples:*

    * **Phase 1:** Systems fundamentals (OS, CLI, low-level programming)
    * **Phase 2:** Applied analysis (basic reversing, initial execution paths)
    * **Phase 3:** Advanced mastery (complex malware, exploit dev, higher-level evasion)

* **Block** — Thematic unit within a phase (e.g., *Computer Architecture & Assembly*, *OS Internals*).

* **Stack** — The smallest learning sequence (topics/tools) needed to complete a block.

* **Mastery Check** — Practical validation (e.g., CrackMes, small tools/libraries, reversing & evasion exercises) proving skills transfer to realistic scenarios.

## Practice Types in TOCD

* **CTF (Capture The Flag):** Guided challenges to cement theory + practice.
* **PBR (Reproducible Lab):** Realistic, challenge-driven projects geared toward bug bounty and professional workflows; fully versioned with evidence.
* **PAD (Analysis & Documentation):** Focused write-ups that articulate methodology, constraints, results, and reproducibility guidance.

---

## Scope & Ethics

* **Lab-only.** All experiments run on my own VMs and benign artifacts.
* **Safety first.** No testing on real systems or third-party infrastructure without explicit authorization.
* **Measurement over claims.** Evasion and “bypass” are framed as **measurable experiments** to understand and improve defenses, not to facilitate misuse.

## Outcome

This is **not** a traditional course. It’s a comprehensive, staged plan that blends theory, labs, simulations, 
and real-world style challenges to produce tangible results: **solid skills**, a **verifiable public portfolio**, and the ability to operate responsibly and effectively in offensive-security lab environments.
